          <h2>Frequently Asked Questions about Word Mixer</h2>
          <h3>How to mix word or names?</h3>
          <p>
            There are many different ways to mix words and names. Some of these
            methods include generating a portmanteau (a word which takes the
            beginning sounds or syllables from two other words), combining
            existing singular nouns into plural forms, or playing with spelling
            variations like switching vowels for consonants (/i/ for /j/, etc.).
          </p>
          <h3>Why mixing word or names?</h3>
          <p>
            There are many reasons to mix words. Perhaps you wanted a new word
            for an invention, or maybe it is just your personal style! Or,
            perhaps the result of mixing two different names would be more
            meaningful than either one on their own? No matter what reason
            drives this process, there can always be something unique and
            interesting about a hybrid name. Mixing words makes it possible to
            create new concepts; these ideas can come from combining surnames
            with first names that have meanings both in mechanics (how they
            combine) as well as in the results (what is generated). This
            personalized approach could also serve as the perfect way to honor
            someone by blending parts of their identity into yours--or even
            creating a proper tribute if desired. There will never end
          </p>
          <h3>What is it called when you combine two words?</h3>
          <p>
            {`Portmanteau word: Portmanteaus are the perfect way to describe your
            love for two things. For example, "frozen yogurt" is a portmanteau
            that combines "ice cream," and its iced counterpart: frozen custard
            or gelato. You will never run out of new words with these fun
            combinations! Portmantuieas combine parts from different other words
            to create something new - like blended ice creams, but more cleverly
            put together than you could ever make on your own.`}
