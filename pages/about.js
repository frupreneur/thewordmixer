          <h2>Our History</h2>
          <p>
            TheWordMixer was founded in 2010 as a simple website for finding
            similar and opposite words. Over time, we have expanded our range of
            available tools to include everything from rhyming words and example
            sentences to translations, definitions, and word forms. Today, we
            are proud to offer one of the most comprehensive collections of
            word-related resources on the web.
