          <h2>Anglo-Saxon Origins</h2>
          <p>
            {`The Anglo-Saxon period in England lasted from the 5th century to the
            11th century, and during this time, the English language was heavily
            influenced by Germanic languages. The Anglo-Saxon language was the
            root of Old English, and many words in the English language today
            are derived from Old English. Words like "bread," "water," and
            "house" have Anglo-Saxon origins. Even though Old English is no
            longer spoken, it has left a significant impact on the English
            language.`}
          </p>
          <h2>Latin and French Influence</h2>
          <p>
            In the 11th century, the Normans invaded England, and with them came
            the French language. Latin, the language of the Roman Empire, also
            had a significant impact on the English language. Both Latin and
            French have contributed to the English vocabulary, and many English
            words today are derived from these languages.
          </p>
          <p>
            {`Words like "president," "government," and "police" come from French,
            while words like "doctor," "piano," and "agenda" come from Latin.
            These languages have also contributed to the English language in
            other ways. Latin and French are the languages of law, medicine, and
            science, and many words in these fields are derived from them.`}
          </p>
          <h2>Other Language Contributions</h2>
          <p>
            English is a language that has borrowed words from many other
            languages, and some of the most significant contributions have come
            from Greek, Spanish, and Arabic.
          </p>
          <p>
            {`Words like "democracy," "philosophy, " and "psychology" have Greek
            origins, while words like "siesta," "quesadilla," and "enchilada"
            come from Spanish. Arabic has also contributed to the English
            vocabulary with words like "coffee," "sugar," and "alcohol."`}
